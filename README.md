learn-automata
==============

Collection of automata-related algorithms for student, including:

1. Recognizing words
    - DFA
    - NFA
    - NFA-e
    
2. Convertion
    - NFA-e to NFA
    - NFA to DFA
    
3. Checking properties
    - Universality
    - Emptiness
    
4. Operation on two automata
    - Complement
    - Union
    - Intersection
    - Symmetric Difference

5. Minimizing
    - Hopcroft algorithm
    - Moore algorithm
    - Brzozowski algorithm

The aim is to visualize every step the algorithms use to reach goal.

Collaboration is welcome!
